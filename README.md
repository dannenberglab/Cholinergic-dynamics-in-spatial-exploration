# Cholinergic dynamics in spatial exploration
This project utilizes fiber photometry to record the population activity of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) at sub-second timescales. The experiments were conducted using Chat-Cre mice performing an object location memory (ObLoM) task. Mice were video-tracked to quantify movement speed and behavioral patterns.
This repository provides multiple functions for analyzing the collected data, offering tools to streamline and enhance the analysis process.
